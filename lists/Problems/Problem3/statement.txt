Problem:-
If there is a loop inside linked list return the starting Node of that loop.

Approach 1:-
Just as we found if the linked list contains a loop, we assign head to slow iterator and now both iterator moves at same speed. The node at which both iterator meets again shall be the starting of the loop.
