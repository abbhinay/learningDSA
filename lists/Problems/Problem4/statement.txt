Problem:-
If there is a loop inside linked list return the length of that loop.

Approach 1:-
Just as we found the starting of loop in previous problem,we stop traversing the slow iterator and fast iterator starts moving at previous speed. A counter is also used to track the movement of fast iterator. By the time the fast iterator arrives at the same position as slow iterator, we return the counter.
