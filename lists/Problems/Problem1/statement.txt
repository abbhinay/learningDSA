Find the Nth node from the end of linked list.

Approach 1:-
we start from head and count the no of nodes present after the current head. 
If the count is less than (N-1) then we cannot find the node simply because the N is too large and the no number of nodes are less than what is being asked.
If the count is more than (N-1) then we simply assign the current node to next node and repeat the process.
By the time the count is equal to (N-1), the current node will be the node that is the required node. We simply return the data present at that node.
