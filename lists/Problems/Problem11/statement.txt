Problem :-
check if the linked list is palindrom or not.

Approach 1:-
we find the length of linke dlist from length method and traverse up to the middle point. 
After that if the list contains even no of nodes we pass the next node as a parameter to reverse the remaining list.
If the no of nodes are odd then we pass a node next to the current node, leaving the middle node of linked list.
Once half the linked list is reversed then we compare the data on the first half and second half of linked list.
If at any point, we find any mismatch in the data then we return false as return. 
Else we return true.
