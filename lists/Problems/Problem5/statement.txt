Problem:-
Reverse a singly Linked List.

Approach 1:-
This approach is very similar to swapping two numbers.
We take 2 iterators current and previous. Initially we assign head to current iterator and null to previous iterator. We iterate throughout the linked list by using current iterator.
Inside the loop we create a next node and assign next node of current to it.
Then we assign previous iterator as the next node of current.
Then we assign current to previous.
Then we assign next to current.
In the end we return the previous iterator.
